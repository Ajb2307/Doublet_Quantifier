# Doublet_Quantifier

This code is used as a method to quantify these doublet absorption lines, fitting two absorptions simultaneously, and provide parameters for exploring
aspects of both the shape and size of these absorption lines. The key model in this method used here is the pseudo-Voigt function, which is a linear combination of a Gaussian function and Lorentzian profile.
