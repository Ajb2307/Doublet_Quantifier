# Doublet_Quantifier

This code is used as a tool to quantify these doublet absorption lines, fitting two absorptions simultaneously, and provide parameters for exploring
aspects of both the shape and size of these absorption lines. The key model in this method used here is the __pseudo-Voigt function__, which is a linear combination of a Gaussian function and Lorentzian profile. 

Work done at Brown Dwarf New York City (BDNYC) and American Museum of Natural History (AMNH)
